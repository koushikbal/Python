AWS Lambda Function for Restoring RDS Instance from Snapshot

Overview:
This AWS Lambda function is designed to automate the process of restoring an Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) instance from a specified custom snapshot. It retrieves necessary information such as the latest automated backup of the source RDS instance, then restores a new instance from that backup while configuring it based on the source instance's settings. Finally, it updates an .env file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket with the new RDS endpoint URL.

Prerequisites:
* An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create Lambda functions, access Secrets Manager, RDS, and S3 services.
* Python 3.6 or later installed locally for development and testing purposes.
* AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) configured with appropriate credentials and region settings.

Setup Instructions:
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Install the required Python packages using pip:
* Copy code
* pip install boto3
* Modify the lambda_handler function in lambda_function.py according to your specific requirements. Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set     correctly.
* Deploy the Lambda function to your AWS account using the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console.
* Ensure that your Lambda function has appropriate IAM permissions to access necessary AWS services like Secrets Manager, RDS, and S3.
* Set up the required Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information securely.
* Create an S3 bucket to store the .env file and configure appropriate permissions for the Lambda function to access it.
* Test the Lambda function by triggering it manually or setting up a scheduled event.
* Monitor the execution logs and verify that the RDS instance restoration process is successful.
* Ensure that the updated .env file is correctly uploaded to the designated S3 bucket.

Usage:
* This Lambda function can be triggered manually or automatically using AWS CloudWatch Events.
* Ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly before triggering the function.
